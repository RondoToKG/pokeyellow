# Pokemon Let's Go Yellow

The following is an in-progress rom hack of Pokemon Yellow based on the Pret disassembly project. The goal of this project is to implement many of the modern features contained within the official remake, Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu & Eevee (LGPE).

As of currently, the following features have been implemented:
	
- Physical/Special split: all original Gen 1 moves have had their modern physical/special/status categories applied. These categories can be seen on the move selection screen of the battle UI.

- Additionally, all moves have had their base stats updated to be accurate to their values in LGPE. This includes LGPE exclusive buffs such as 200 base power Solarbeam & Sky Attack as well as 40 base power Absorb & 75 base power Mega Drain.

- Addition of the Steel, Dark, & Fairy Type and modernized type chart. 

- Wild encounter tables expanded from 10 to 12 and are almost entirely similar to LGPE. Version exclusive encounter rates split in half to fit both encounters on one table. All 151 pokemon are catchable.

- Updated Pokemon to their official types and base stats.
